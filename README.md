# triage-spa-v2

Triage is a lifesaving todolist which automatically prioritizes tasks for you

Please don't attempt to view the source code on glitch.me (only the built assets are there)

Source code at https://github.com/JCharante/triage-spa-v2

I know you can't trust commit times (and I actually plan to continue working on this) but as far as I'm aware you can't fake when releases are created, so you can check under https://github.com/JCharante/triage-spa-v2/releases
